# PDF Summarization Web Application

This project provides a web application built with Flask to extract and summarize text from PDF documents. The application uses various NLP models including BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet for text summarization. It also includes functionality to parse tables from PDF files.

## Features

- Extract text from PDF files.
- Summarize extracted text using BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet models.
- Parse tables from PDF documents.
- Download the summary as a PDF file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/g3tawayfrom/PDF_Summarization.git
    cd PDF_Summarization
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Open your web browser and go to:**

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

3. **Use the application:**

    - You can input text directly or upload a PDF file to extract and summarize its content.
    - View the generated summaries for BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet.
    - Download the summary as a PDF file.

## File Structure
